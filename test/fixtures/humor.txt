SUB1|Marx Brothers, George S. Kaufman, Walter Winchell
DESC|First Book published by noted wordsmith and wit of the 1920s and 1930s, a collection of light verse, much of which first appeared in Franklin Adams' newspaper column, The Conning Tower." Ryskind collaborated with George S. Kaufman on many hit plays of the era, co-authored the script for the Marx Brothers' Duck Soup, and was the co-author (with George S. Kaufman and the Gershwins) of Of Thee I Sing, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize, and its sequel, Let 'Em Eat Cake. This copy is INSCRIBED BY THE AUTHOR TO NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST WALTER WINCHELL on the Front End Paper as follows: "Apr. 28, 1926 / For Walter Winchell - / exclusively. / /s/Morrie Ryskind." The inscription is a dig at Winchell's insistence that any tips or inside information given to him must be "an exclusive." Printing unstated; Title Page has 1921 date at bottom, with copyright line on verso dated 1920; 121 pp. VG/Fr.-Pr. condition.  Dust Jacket, in new archival-quality Brodart Protector, is heavily chipped and edge-worn, with large ink stain on front panel; repairs on reverse side of DJ with acid-free archival tape; browning and light soiling on panels and flaps; rear panel features ad for Spring 1921 Borzoi Poetry List, including T.S. Eliot's The Sacred Wood; front panel remains readable, with short description of the book and its author; short bio of Ryskind on front flap, including a proposed inscription for his tombstone: "And let this be his Epitaph / This bard made even highbrows laugh." Book is bound in light green boards with red lettering along spine and at top of front cover; crimping and slight chipping at top & bottom of spine; small remnant of DJ stuck to front cover, bottom-right, with black ink; some scuffing and areas of light fading to boards; light browning and some wear along top & bottom edges of boards; ends browned, with some soiling to top-stain; check marks have been penciled next to some of the poems in the book (possibly in Winchell's hand); otherwise interior is tight and clean. A remarkable association copy between two important figures of Broadway's Golden Era in the 1920s that comes from the Estate of Rose Bigman, who was Winchell's "Girl Friday" for many years.
