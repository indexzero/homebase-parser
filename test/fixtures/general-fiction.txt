Dust Jacket, in new archival-quality Brodart Protector, is price-clipped; slight chipping at top & bottom of spine, which is lightly browned; half-inch closed tear and adjacent creasing on front panel, top-right; small stain at bottom of front panel; small closed tear on rear panel, bottom-right, along edge of spine; light edge wear and scuffing in spots, along with some light browning around outer edges; front panel design remains vivid. Book is bound in brown boards; crimp at top of spine; area of fading at top of front cover; interior pages have small indentation, bottom-left (possibly caused by a small pebble or object pressed between the covers); some "give" to binding in preface; otherwise binding remains sound with clean pages throughout, except as noted. Book includes facsimile of Tenniel's letter to Carroll with a preliminary sketch of the wasp and a facsimile of the long-lost galley. H-5
