# homebase-parser

Parser & file reader for the ABE Homebase 2.0 text (*.txt) format. 

## Usage

``` js
const { Parser, readFile } = require('homebase-parser');

// Read book data
const books = await readFile('path/to/your/file.txt');

// Do stuff with book data
// ... profit?
```

## Seriously though ‚Äì¬†what's all this then? 

üê≤ Here be dragons. While using ABE Homebase (don't ask why) this file format
was discovered. There is literally no documentation for it. No where. Any
where. Not even in the [ABE Homebase 2.3 User Guide]. Looking for a sample?

And why would there be? The software itself is more or less dead. So why make
this? Because books ‚Äì¬†lots of books (seriously don't ask).
